## Discussion:
We reported what we have finished to Miguel, such as "upload media", "create question on quiz", "Create options for a question".
We have discussed what tasks we should finish after the Chinese New Year holiday,  to complete the prototype.
And discussed what extra features we may implement them in coming months, such as word cloud, export the quiz result by using a bar chart/pie chart, export as pdf, etc.


## Challenges:
We are not familiar with JavaScript/jQuery, we have difficult to implement our idea. We want to hide the form (which create the question) until we click a button. In fact, we have done this in other place, but when we implement on our project, it failed. 

## Schedule:
After Holiday, we need to finish the prototype, including "Teacher create the quiz", "Student join and do quiz", "Grading the quiz" and "Output the result".
