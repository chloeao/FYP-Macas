## Attendees:
Simon, Donald, Carman, Chloe

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes):
The relationship between “Questions” and “Quizzes”. And it can show the questions in a quiz.

## Discussion:
We start to build up some function to test the Ruby on Rails environment, because the cloud’s volume is too small, 
so we decided to use the lab’s physical server instead of cloud. We are learning the git command so that we can do our project 
separately, and merge them after changes are made. Miguel has found Ricardo to help us solving the problem in Ruby on Rails, 
and he taught us how to set the many-to-many relationship in database tables, also answer some of the doubt in Ruby on Rails. 
Finally, we install sublime and use git command to put our codes into bitbucket.

## Challenges:
When installing ruby on rails on MacOS, the method or commands are different, compared to Ubuntu. 
Therefore, we need to find another way to install ruby on rails and sublime on MacOS.

## Schedule:
After the meeting, we have to know how to set up Ruby on Rails and how to use it
