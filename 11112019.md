## Attendees:
Simon, Donald, Carman, Chloe

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes):
We have installed ruby on rails on other computers by using VM or Mac. Also, the sublime has installed too. 
And make the "Students" table. Make the relationship of "Student" table and "Quizzes" table is many-to-many. 
Show the student have taken which quizzes and show the quiz have been taken by who on their views.

## Discussion:
We start to build up some function to test the Ruby on Rails environment, and we found that one of the kits of 
Ruby on Rails (DEVISE) can achieve the user login and authentication. Then, we try to test it on our environment, 
it can help us to build up the login function of our website automatically. In the process of our test, we have 
created the “Student” table and “quizzes” table, also can display a student’s quizzes in his personal page, 
and we try to test other functions such as create instructor account and modify quizzes. 
Moreover, Simon has tried to upload files(picture/audio/video) on our website.

## Challenges:
How to decide the functions, database, etc., and familiar with the environment of Ruby on Rails. 
When a user created, he needs to edit the information after register, cannot fill in the information when registering. 
It is one of the problems now. Another challenge is about uploading file, it can only upload picture files. 
Other files format cannot upload.

## Schedule:
Find William to setup our server and open the ports for us to access to this server. 
Keep testing the functions include create instructor account, add quiz, delete quiz, edit quiz, etc.
